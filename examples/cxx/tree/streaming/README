This example shows how to create an XML document by performing multiple
serializations of its smaller parts. This can be useful when the
document is too large to fit into memory or when the other end needs
to start processing without waiting for the whole document (streaming).

The example consists of the following files:

records.xsd
  XML Schema which describes a collection of data records.

records.hxx
records.cxx
  C++ types that represent the given vocabulary as well as serialization
  functions. These are generated by XSD from records.xsd.

driver.cxx
  Driver for the example. It progressively serializes one thousand data
  record into a file (out.xml).

To run the example simply execute:

$ ./driver
